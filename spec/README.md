Challenge

To work on this challenge, first:

Setup a new project directory recipes_directory.
Create a new database recipes_directory.
Create a new test database recipes_directory_test for your tests.
Then:

Design and create the table for the following user stories.

As a food lover,
So I can stay organised and decide what to cook,
I'd like to keep a list of all my recipes with their names.

As a food lover,
So I can stay organised and decide what to cook,
I'd like to keep the average cooking time (in minutes) for each recipe.

As a food lover,
So I can stay organised and decide what to cook,
I'd like to give a rating to each of the recipes (from 1 to 5).
Test-drive the Repository class for this new table. You should design, test-drive and implement two methods all and find.

Write code in the main file app.rb so it prints out the list of recipes.
